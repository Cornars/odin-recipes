## What am I doing?
I am currently trying to learn how to make websites from scratch. I've been learning how to make some since it's part of our classes but I want to try and learn it from the ground up, slow and steady. This project is the first of many.

## What is this?
One of my main problems here in DLSU is cooking. As much as cooking seems enjoyable and cheap, it's tiring to wash dishes. However, if I were to grow out of this laziness, I think these are the top 3 dishes that I can think of that I will 
enjoy.
